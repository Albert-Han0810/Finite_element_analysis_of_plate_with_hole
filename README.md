# Finite_element_analysis_of_plate_with_hole
This is a finite element analysis of plate with hole basics on Matlab//这是一个基于MaTlab的对简单带孔板件的有限元分析
The file from "r=1mm.stl" to "r=5mm.stl" are the plate with holes'geometric model//文件从"r=1mm.stl"到"r=5mm.stl"是带孔板件的几何模型
The file "main.m" and the file "calculate.m" are the simulation process// "main.m" 和 "calculate.m"是仿真过程
The file "plate_hole.mlapp" is a little GUI I made(There are some small bugs I need time to repair them)//"plate_hole.mlapp"是我做的一个图形化界面（有些小bug我懒得改了）
